# Etch-a-Sketch
A virtual etch-a-sketch. The purpose of this project was to practice DOM manipulation and DOM event triggers.
While styling the page I also took the opportunity to learn CSS grid, as I assumed that would be the easiest way to accomplish the page format and the etch-a-sketch container format.
